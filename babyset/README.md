# babyset
A simple project to demonstrate unit testing. This project is a very simple illustration of using Python's builtin **unittest** module.

## You Try It

1. Fork then clone the project () to your computer.
3. Complete the testing tasks listed below then commit and push your changes back up to your GitHub repo.

## Development Tasks: Using Python unittest module.
The babyset project contains a src directory that contains the definition for a class named *BabySet* (baby_set.py) and a file containing **unittests** for the BabySet class methods (test_babyset.py).


### Step 1:

**Run the tests.** ==> ```python test_babyset.py```

```test_baby_set.py``` requires that you implement the unit tests for ```test_init_empty``` and ```test_remove``` and ```test_clear```. Out of the box these three unit tests are passing. Read ```baby_set.py``` to understand what you need to test and use the existing unit test implementations as a guide.

### Step 2. 
Commit your changes and push to your remote repository.
